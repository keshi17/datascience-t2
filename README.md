Analysis and Conclusions:
59% % of people did not survive while 
40 % percent survived.
There is a relatively smaller number of children (around 5-15 years old) and elderly passengers (above 60 years old) on the Titanic
Passengers in Class 1 had a higher chance of survival compared to those in Class 2 and Class 3. This suggests that the passenger class might have influenced the survival rate
Class 3 had the highest number of passengers but the lowest survival rate, indicating a potential class-based hierarchy in rescue efforts
Survived and Fare: There is a positive correlation between "Survived" and "Fare," suggesting that passengers who paid higher fares had a higher chance of survival.
Age vs. Survived: there might be a slight concentration of younger survivors
